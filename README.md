## Purpose

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project I made to test the use of Vercel's ai sdk and Supabase for authentication and hosting of a Postgres database. This is not designed to be a fully polished website.

## Getting Started

Make sure to set the environment variables(.env.local) to your values

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Use `build` instead of `dev` to compile a production build.
To run the production build:
```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
